# Xamarin iOS Parallax PageView
A few month ago, as I was working on [Anytram](http://anytram.com), a public transport app for the city of Strasbourg, I had to develop a PageView system featuring parallax backgrounds on each view. I thought that such a system would be interesting for many so I am releasing the code I developed for this feature.

## How it looks

## What's in
When you will checkout the project, you will have a working Xamarin iOS sample project to start a PageView based app featuring parallax backgrounds. Just open the .sln project file and launch the simulator to see the magic.


I tried to make the project as readable and easy to use as possible, it should be a great start point for your future projects.
